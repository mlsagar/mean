1- Make sure you have mongoDB installed and running on your system. Create a SchoolDB with a "students" collection. Then add the following documents:

John, 3.1
James, 2.8
Jasmin, 3.5

2- Export the SchoolDB to a json file as a pretty array and upload that.

3- Import the games DB found in the resources folder. Then write a NodeJS program (using express) to display 3 games from the database or as many as the user specifies but not exceeding 7. (this is your mean games project).

4. Add all CRD (Create, Read, Delete) operations to your meanGames application (the same one from step 3 above). When adding a new game the new game must have a title, and price, the minimum number of players must be between 1 and 10, Minimum age must be between 7-99.
